# 42 Berlin Piscine – My Journey

Welcome to my Piscine repository from the 42 Berlin bootcamp 🎓. This repository contains all the exercises I completed during the month-long acceptance program known as the "Piscine."

## 🧠 About the Piscine

The Piscine is an intense coding bootcamp designed to evaluate candidates' aptitude in problem solving, persistence, and self-learning. During this time, I worked through daily challenges in C programming, shell scripting, and Unix fundamentals.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- C
- Shell
- Git
- Vim
- GCC

## 🧵 Programming Techniques Practiced

- Pointer manipulation
- Recursion
- Memory allocation
- Arrays and string handling
- `main` function arguments (`argc`, `argv`)

## ⚙️ How to Compile and Run

💡 **Note:** Most exercises do not include a `main` function, as required by the Piscine's instructions. However, I’ve included **commented-out `main` functions** in most files for testing purposes.  
You can uncomment them to compile and test the code.

To compile an exercise, use:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o exercise C00/ex00/example.c
```

Then run the compiled executable:

```bash
./exercise
```
